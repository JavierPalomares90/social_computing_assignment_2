Feasible region corner vertices: \\
$(0, 0)$ \\
$(0, 3)$ \\
$(10/7, 16/7)$ \\
$(2, 0)$ 

\subsection{Answer 1c}

By the simplex algorithm the optimval value is at one of the vertices. 
Evaluating the objective function at each of the vertices, we find the
the optimal value of the Primal objective function is 18 
at $(x_1,x_2) = (0,3)$

\subsection{Answer 1f}

The optimum solution for the Dual objective function is $(y_{1}, y_{2}) = (0, 3)$, which gives an optimum value of 18 (same as for the primal).

\section{Question 2}
Show that the man-oriented Gale-Shapley algorithm gives the woman-pessimal stable matching, i.e., each woman is paired with her worst valid partner of all stable matchings. 

\subsection{Answer 2}

\textbf{Proof} by contradiction:

Let $M = \{ \ldots, (m, w), \ldots \}$ be the set of male optimal marriages from the output of the male-oriented Gale-Shapley algorithm. 

Suppose that there exists a stable matching that is not woman pessimal, represented by $M' = \{ \ldots, (m', w), \ldots, (m, w'), \ldots\}$ such that $m$ is not the pessimal choice for $w$. In this scenario , $w$ prefers $m$ over $m'$. However, if the stable marriage is also male optimal, then $m$ prefers $w$ over $w'$. 

The above case is a contradiction because this creates a blocking pair, which proves that such a marriage $M'$ is not stable. Therefore, a male optimal pairing must be woman pessimal.

\section{Question 3}
Suppose that you are given an instance of a stable marriage problem, i.e., the ordered lists of men preferences and the ordered list of women preferences.\\

(a) You are given a particular couple $(m, w)$ as an additional input. Give an algorithm to determine if there exists a stable marriage with $m$ assigned to $w$.\\
(b) What certificate can you give to your friend to show that there is no stable marriage with $(m, w)$ pair?\\
(c) What certificate can you give to your friend to show that there is a stable marriage with ($m, w$) pair?

\subsection{Answer 3a}

Modify the Gale-Shapely stable marriage algorithm with a constraint that the $(m*,w*)$ is already assigned (married).

\textbf{Inputs}:\\
1. $mPref$: data structure containing preferences for each man \\
2. $wPref$: data structure containing preferences for each woman \\
3. $mrank$: where $mrank[i][j]$ indicates the rank of woman $j$ for man $i$; higher preference correlates to lower rank \\
4. $wrank$: where $wrank[i][j]$ indicates the rank of man $j$ for woman $i$; higher preference correlates to lower rank \\

\textbf{Algorithm}:\\
1. freelist = list of men who are free (initially has all men except $m*$) \\
2. while (freelist is not empty): \\
\hspace*{7mm} 3. choose some man $m$ from freelist \\
\hspace*{7mm} 4. $m$ proposes to his most preferred woman $w$ that he has not already proposed to, and is not $w*$ \\
\hspace*{7mm} 5. if $w$ is free: \\
\hspace*{14mm} 6. $w$ accepts proposal (assign $m$ to $w$) \\ 
\hspace*{7mm} 7. else: // $w$ is already engaged to $m′$ \\
\hspace*{14mm} 8. if $wrank[w][m] > wrank[w][m′]$: // $w$ prefers $m′$ \\
\hspace*{21mm} 9. add $m$ back to freelist // reject $m$; $w$ still engaged to $m′$ \\
\hspace*{14mm} 10. else: \\
\hspace*{21mm} 11. add $m′$ back to the freelist // reject $m′$ \\ 
\hspace*{21mm} 12. $w$ gets engaged to $m$ \\
13. for each $(m, w)$ marriage assignment that isnot $(m*, w*)$ \\
\hspace*{14mm} 14. if $mrank[m][w] > mrank[m][w*]$ and $wrank[w*][m*] > wrank[w*][m]$: \\
\hspace*{21mm} 15. Print blocking pair found, then exit \\
\hspace*{14mm} 16. else: \\
\hspace*{21mm} 17. Continue through for loop to next marriage assignment \\ 
18. Print stable marriage exists with $m*$ assigned to $w*$

\subsection{Answer 3b}

The certificate that can be shown to prove that their is no stable marriage with the ($m, w$) pair is to show that their exists a blocking pair, which is couple pairing ($m', w'$) in which  $m$ prefers $w'$ to $w$, and $w'$ prefers $m$ to $m'$.
